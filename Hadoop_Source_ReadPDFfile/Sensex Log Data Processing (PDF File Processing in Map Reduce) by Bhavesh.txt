POC #: Sensex Log Data Processing (PDF File Processing in Map Reduce) by Bhavesh on 01:39
Industry: Financial
Data: Input Format - .PDF (Our Input Data is in PDF Format)
Like this below created 3000 records on my own 

Input Dataset with attributes like:

Column
Description
1
SENSEXID
2
SENSEXNAME
3
TYPEOFTRADING
4
SENSEXLOC
5
OPEN_BALANCE
6
CLOSING_BAL
7
FLTUATION_RATE


Problem Statement: Analyse the data in Hadoop Eco-system to:

1.       Take the complete PDF Input data on HDFS

2.       Develop a Map Reduce Use Case to get the below filtered results from the HDFS Input       
data(Excel data)

     If TYPE OF TRADING is -->'SIP'

          - OPEN_BALANCE > 25000 & FLTUATION_RATE > 10  --> store "HighDemandMarket"
          -CLOSING_BALANCE<22000 & FLTUATION_RATE IN BETWEEN 20 - 30  --> store "OnGoingMarketStretegy"
              
     If TYPE OF TRADING is -->'SHORTTERM
   
          - OPEN_BALANCE < 5000 --> store "WealthyProducts"
          - SensexLoc --> "NewYork OR Mumbai"  --> â€œReliableProducts
    else
          store in "OtherProducts"

  NOTE: In the mentioned file names only 5 outputs have to be generated

  3. Develop a PIG Script to filter the Map Reduce Output in the below fashion

       - Provide the Unique data

       - Sort the Unique data based on SensexID.

  4. EXPORT the same PIG Output from HDFS to MySQL using SQOOP

  5. Store the same PIG Output in a HIVE External Table
